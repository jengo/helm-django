# helm-django

This helm template is intentionally very generic and basic.  This is meant to act as a starting point to get your application up and running with little effort.

This goes hand and hand with [Jolene Engo's (jengo) simple django boiler plate with docker and Kubernetes](https://github.com/jengo/django).
